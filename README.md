## About project
Project "Difference calculator" is a console utility that determines the difference between two data structures.
It works with yaml and json input data formats and generates reports on changes in the first file relative to the second one. Reports are presented in three different representations: JSON,
a report highlighting changed information by adding +- signs and a report with a verbal description of the changes.
Installed by generating a whl file (make a build) and then install it by entering the package manager.
The utility is called by the "gendiff" command. Work examples below:
